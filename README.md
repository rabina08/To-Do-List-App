# ✅ To-Do List Web App

A simple, clean web-based To-Do List application built using **Python (Flask)** and **HTML templates**. It allows users to add, update, and delete tasks — all stored in a local database.

## 📌 Introduction

This project is a minimalistic To-Do List app designed to help users manage daily tasks efficiently. It was built using Python with the Flask framework, with templates rendered using Jinja2.

The app uses a simple SQLite database to store tasks, and follows basic CRUD operations:
- Create
- Read
- Update
- Delete


## ⚠️ Challenges Faced

While building this project, I faced and overcame several challenges:

- 🔄 Connecting and managing a **SQLite database** using Flask
- 🧩 Structuring **HTML templates** with `layout.html` and reusing content blocks
- ❗ Handling user inputs and form validation
- 🧠 Understanding how to structure routes and pass data between them
- 😅 Setting up and pushing the project to GitHub
